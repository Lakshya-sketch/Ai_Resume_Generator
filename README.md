# Ai_Resume_Generator
AI Resume Generator is a simple web application that lets users upload their old resume in PDF format and instantly transform it into a fresh, ATS‑friendly design. Using the power of the OpenAI GPT API, it rewrites and improves the content based on a short prompt from the user (e.g., target job role or keywords). The backend extracts the text from the uploaded file, sends it to the AI for enhancement, and returns a clean, downloadable PDF using a predefined professional template.
